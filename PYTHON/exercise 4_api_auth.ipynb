    "Assume that user input is correct. e.g. `USD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `requests` library, query the current exchange rate of the input currency to `PLN`. Use the resulting rate in your calculations to convert the specified amount into the currency of your choice, and display the result in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<INPUT AMOUNT> PLN = <CALCULATED AMOUNT> <INPUT CURRENCY>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. if the user enters `USD` and `1000`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1000 PLN = 269.44 USD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `round` function to give the result to two decimal places.\n",

    "Test your code by specifying a currency that does not exist.\n",

    "Do not modify the code that asks the user and sends the request to the server. **Using nothing but the server response** decide whether you need to display the converted amount (as in part 1 of the exercise), or to inform the user that the currency they entered does not exist. **Hint:** responses to incorrect queries have a special `status_code`.\n",
